About
=====

This library gathers a collection of music signal processing algorithms written
by several people. The documentation of each algorithms contains a brief
description and references to the corresponding papers.

Publications
------------

Substantial informations about several of the algorithms and their evaluation
are gathered in:

  - Paul Brossier, `Automatic annotation of musical audio for interactive
    systems <https://aubio.org/phd>`_, PhD thesis, Centre for Digital music,
    Queen Mary University of London, London, UK, 2006.

Additional results obtained with this software were discussed in the following
papers:

  - P. M. Brossier and J. P. Bello and M. D. Plumbley, `Real-time temporal
    segmentation of note objects in music signals
    <https://aubio.org/articles/brossier04fastnotes.pdf>`_ in *Proceedings of
    the International Computer Music Conference*, 2004, Miami, Florida, ICMA

  - P. M. Brossier and J. P. Bello and M. D. Plumbley, `Fast labelling of note
    objects in music signals
    <https://aubio.org/articles/brossier04fastnotes.pdf>`, in *Proceedings of
    the International Symposium on Music Information Retrieval*, 2004,
    Barcelona, Spain
