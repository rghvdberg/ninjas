Welcome
=======

aubio is a collection of algorithms and tools to label and transform music and
sounds. It scans or `listens` to audio signals and attempts to detect musical
events. For instance, when a drum is hit, at which frequency is a note, or at
what tempo is a rhythmic melody.

aubio features include segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks,
performing pitch detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from
live audio.

Features
========

aubio provides several algorithms and routines, including:

- several onset detection methods
- different pitch detection methods
- tempo tracking and beat detection
- MFCC (mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients)
- FFT and phase vocoder
- up/down-sampling
- digital filters (low pass, high pass, and more)
- spectral filtering
- transient/steady-state separation
- sound file read and write access
- various mathematics utilities for music applications

The name aubio comes from *audio* with a typo: some errors are likely to be
found in the results.
